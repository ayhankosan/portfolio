description: The project focused on developing a comprehensive methodology for identifying and monitoring peatland areas in the European Alps, recognizing their crucial role in carbon sequestration, water regulation and biodiversity conservation. To achieve this, satellite imagery from Sentinel-1 (SAR) and Sentinel-2 (Optical) was processed using Google Earth Engine, integrating advanced pre-processing techniques, machine learning classification and accuracy assessment to generate a robust peatland extent map.To ensure high-quality input data, both Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 datasets underwent extensive pre-processing. Sentinel-1 imagery was refined through orbit filtering, radiometric calibration, orthorectification, thermal noise removal, border noise removal and speckle filtering, enhancing the radar data for accurate classification. Sentinel-2 optical imagery was corrected for atmospheric distortions, cloud-masked to remove interference and processed to calculate key vegetation indices such as NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index), PSRI (Plant Senescence Reflectance Index), ARI (Anthocyanin Reflectance Index), MNDWI (Modified Normalized Difference Water Index), NDWI (Normalized Difference Water Index) and EVI (Enhanced Vegetation Index). A JavaScript-based data pipeline automated the extraction of these indices for different seasons, allowing for systematic monitoring of peatland dynamics. Following pre-processing, Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 datasets were integrated into time-series composites, enabling seasonal and annual observations. A dimensionality reduction step using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was applied to optimize feature selection and improve classification accuracy. Training and validation datasets were then created through visual image interpretation and automated sample selection, ensuring a diverse representation of peatland characteristics. For classification, the study employed machine learning algorithms, specifically Random Forest and Support Vector Machines (SVM), with parameter optimization to enhance model performance. These classifiers were trained on the selected dataset to accurately distinguish peatland areas from other land cover types. The resulting classified imagery was validated against an independent dataset, followed by accuracy assessment using a confusion matrix and kappa coefficient to quantify reliability.Additionally, a custom script was developed to allow for specific observation of known peatland areas, enabling the exploration of ecosystem health over a user-defined time period. This tool provided valuable insights into peatland changes, vegetation health and hydrological fluctuations, supporting a deeper understanding of their ecological stability and potential degradation over time. The final output of this methodology was a peatland extent map, providing an effective tool for long-term monitoring and conservation planning. By integrating multi-source remote sensing data, machine learning and systematic evaluation techniques, this approach establishes a scalable framework for peatland conservation and sustainable environmental management in alpine regions.
